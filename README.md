# Identity

*Identity* is a Minecraft Forge mod inspired by [Morph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/morph).
This version is actively maintained and updated by me, as the original creator seems to have stepped away from further development.

**Versions**:

|        | Forge |
|--------|-------|
| 1.21.1 | ✅    |

This project targets Minecraft 1.21.1 on Forge and builds using JDK 21.

With *Identity*, you can become anything you want, friend or foe, hot or cold, fluffy or rough.
