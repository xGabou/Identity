# AGENTS

This repository hosts **Identity**, a Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 mod written in Java.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use four spaces for indentation.
- Keep braces on the same line as declarations (`if (...) {`).
- Ensure files end with a newline.

## Build / Checks
- The project uses Gradle. The wrapper is not included, so use the system `gradle` command.
- Run `gradle build` from the repository root after any changes. This is the current programmatic check. The build may fail if external dependencies cannot be resolved.
- No test suite exists yet.
- Build with **JDK 17**. Ensure the PATH and `java` command reference JDK 17 before running Gradle.

## Environment Setup
- Install `apt-utils` to prevent debconf warnings:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-utils
  ```
- Install the JDK 17 package if it isn't present:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk
  sudo dpkg --configure -a
  ```
- Set `java` and `javac` to the OpenJDK 17 binaries via `update-alternatives` and ensure they appear first in `PATH` when building.
